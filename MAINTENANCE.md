# RSS SponsorBlock Maintenance Log

## Current Status
- Docker implementation completed with minimal build
- Ready for one-command setup with `docker-compose up -d`
- Image size: 322MB (includes FFmpeg and all runtime dependencies)
- Completed refactoring: STORAGE_AUDIO_DIR replaced with path.join(STORAGE_DIR, 'audio')

## Docker Implementation Progress
- [x] Created MAINTENANCE.md to track progress
- [x] Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [x] docker-compose.yml configuration
- [x] .dockerignore file
- [x] README.md Docker instructions
- [x] Test Docker setup - Build successful!
- [x] Simplified by removing unnecessary entrypoint script
- [x] Created truly minimal Dockerfile with:
  - Single COPY command in build stage
  - npm prune --production after build
  - Dynamic port configuration
  - Simplified to 26 lines total

## Discoveries
- App uses TypeScript with tsx for development
- SQLite database with Knex ORM
- FFmpeg required for audio processing
- Gemini API for ad detection
- No existing Docker configuration

## Approach
- Multi-stage Docker build for smaller images
- Alpine Linux base for minimal size
- docker-compose for easy setup
- Persistent volumes for storage and database

## Recent Changes
- Replaced STORAGE_AUDIO_DIR environment variable with STORAGE_DIR
- Updated episode.service.ts and download.service.ts to use path.join(STORAGE_DIR, 'audio')
- Updated .env file to use STORAGE_DIR instead of STORAGE_AUDIO_DIR
- Fixed healthcheck to use IPv4 (127.0.0.1) to avoid IPv6 issues
- Added storage directory creation with proper permissions in Dockerfile
